# Meet me in Reality!
Project Description: Explore ways to enhance a sense of belonging for RMIT students through digital connectivity to encourage students in easing back into on-campus, in person connections, in the form of a mobile app. Since lockdowns in 2020 there has been an increased emphasis on remote and online study, causing students to experience significant isolation from peers and staff in contrast to the prior, mainly face-to-face experience. In this project you will explore a range of options based on initial requirements gathering and team skill set. For example, the app could be used to make introductions to students in the same cohort to organise safe meet-ups on campus.
